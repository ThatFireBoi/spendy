        Our journey began as two employees of Banco Popular, selected for a unique opportunity at Holberton Coding School, fully sponsored to innovate in project-based learning. Inspired by Banco Popular's MiBanco app, we recognized its potential for enhancement. Our goal was clear: to reimagine MiBanco, making it as user friendly as possible but also injecting elements of gamification to incentivize user engagement. The result is a fusion of our banking expertise and coding skills, delivering a more intuitive and, rewarding experience for MiBanco users.
